### Kivy Stuff
.kv files need to use include directive to use other kv files



### Methodology
# Kivy Gui for uncrumped

Communicates over rpc


# Customizing

* Nvim is customizable as is..

# Our ui is customizable by the same token, an external api?

by building a system on data. Plugins in uncrumpled, can add
there own data, to interact with the callbacks and bindings
that the ui requires. (because the ui  talks over this api anyway)

kivy (data)
plugin (data)

so for instance.. plugin to make the bar come out on the right :)

# Events cause invariance, and what we do on those events
